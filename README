This project was created during my phd.
I used it in the development of my application for the ANR Intermed Project : 
http://intermed.csregistry.org/tiki-index.php
http://intermed.lirmm.fr/

I wanted to create a model for Web documents representation. 
Something generic enough to use it in many of my personal projects.
I use JPA for peristency.
